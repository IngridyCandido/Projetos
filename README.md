## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive viewer

### What I learned

I learned that I always need to study, and try several times. The solution is not always obvious, but it is always there. There are some things that surprised me how I managed to do even alone. I was happy during construction.

Something I was happy to remember was keeping my site accessible with this piece of code:

```html
<body>
    <main class="container">
        <img class="imagem-qr-code" src="./src/imagens/image-qr-code.png" alt="QR code"/>
```

### Continued development

I want to focus on learning more about CSS Grid and responsiveness. I still have a lot to learn in CSS, there are many interesting things that can be used during the construction of a project.
